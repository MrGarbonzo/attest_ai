# attest_ai Planning Documentation

This directory contains the essential planning documents for the attest_ai MVP build.

## **Active Planning Files**

### **NEW_MVP_BUILD_PLAN.md**
- ✅ **Primary build guide** - Complete 5-week implementation plan
- ✅ **Updated success criteria** - 7 core MVP requirements focused on Secret AI + attestation
- ✅ **Phase-by-phase breakdown** - Week-by-week implementation strategy
- ✅ **Environment setup** - Correct Secret AI SDK patterns
- ✅ **Architecture overview** - Dual attestation + encrypted proof system

### **UPDATED_IMPLEMENTATION_REFERENCES.md**
- ✅ **Technical implementation patterns** - Code examples and best practices
- ✅ **Proof encryption system** - Cryptography library integration
- ✅ **File management** - Local proof storage and downloads
- ✅ **Decryption tool** - Standalone utility for proof verification
- ✅ **Docker & FastAPI patterns** - Production-ready configurations

### **SECRET_AI_ALIGNMENT_ANALYSIS.md**
- ✅ **Alignment validation** - Ensures build plan matches Secret AI best practices
- ✅ **Critical corrections** - Environment variables and SDK patterns
- ✅ **Implementation confidence** - Risk assessment and validation
- ✅ **Action items completed** - Summary of plan updates

## **Key Changes from Original Plan**

### **Removed from MVP (For Later Implementation)**
- ❌ **Arweave integration** - Wallet management, uploads, cost calculations
- ❌ **Complex blockchain storage** - Simplified to local encrypted files
- ❌ **External dependencies** - Focused on core Secret AI functionality

### **Added to MVP**
- ✅ **Proof encryption** - Local file encryption with multiple methods
- ✅ **Download system** - File generation and download endpoints
- ✅ **Decryption tool** - Standalone verification utility
- ✅ **Simplified deployment** - Streamlined SecretVM deployment

## **Implementation Priority**

1. **Week 1**: Environment + Self-attestation
2. **Week 2**: Secret AI integration + Proof encryption
3. **Week 3**: Decryption tool + Download system  
4. **Week 4**: UI enhancement + Integration testing
5. **Week 5**: SecretVM deployment + Validation

## **Future Roadmap**

The current MVP is designed for easy extension:

- **Arweave Module**: Can be added as separate storage layer
- **Advanced Encryption**: Additional cryptographic methods
- **Batch Processing**: Multiple proof handling
- **Web Verification**: Browser-based proof verification

## **Archived Files**

Old planning documents have been moved to `.archive/`:
- `OLD_COMPLETE_IMPLEMENTATION_REFERENCES.md` - Original Arweave-focused patterns
- `OLD_REFINED_MVP_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` - Previous build plan

These are preserved for reference when adding Arweave integration later.
