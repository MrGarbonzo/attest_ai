Obtaining Attestation Data
Attestation Endpoints
All SecretVM machines have a built-in web server that returns the attestation-related data. The server has the following endpoints:

Endpoint
Description
https://<your_machine_url>:29343/cpu.html

Returns the CPU Attestation Quote, generated by the TEE (e.g. Intel TDX or AMD SEV).

https://<your_machine_url>:29343/self.html

Returns the Attestation Report, which includes metadata about the runtime environment and Docker container.

https://<your_machine_url>:29343/gpu.html

Returns the GPU Attestation Quote (only available on machines with GPU support).

Note: upon startupm each SecretVM generates a TLS certificate that is used to secure the communication to the built-in web server. The fingerprint of the certificate is included into the attestation report's reportdata field.

Once you have obtained the information, you can proceed to verifying the VM.
