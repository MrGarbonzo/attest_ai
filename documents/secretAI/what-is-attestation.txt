What is Attestation
What is Attestation?
Attestation is a cryptographic process that produces verifiable evidence about the integrity and identity of a computing environment.

In the context of Confidential Computing, attestation allows a third party to verify that:

The workload is executing inside a genuine Confidential Virtual Machine (CVM).

The CVM is running on authentic Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) hardware (e.g. Intel TDX or AMD SEV).

The environment is running a specific, expected software stackâ€”down to the exact Docker container image.

Attestation in SecretVM
Within SecretVM, attestation is foundational to trust and decentralization. It ensures that:

The VM is built from open-source, independently auditable components (including the kernel, rootfs, and runtime).

A particular Docker container, defined by the user, is the actual workload running inside the VM.

No tampering has occurred at any stage of the boot process or workload initialization.

The attestation process produces a quote, which is submitted to an on-chain Key Management System (KMS) contract on Secret Network. This quote is verified on-chain, allowing confidential keys to be released only to trusted, verified workloads.

In essence, attestation bridges privacy with verifiability, making SecretVM workloads secure, trusted, and provably confidential.
